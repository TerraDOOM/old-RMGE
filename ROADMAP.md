# The big TODO list of the project
This will probably keep getting updated or something so yeah

## Graphics internals
- implement instanced drawing
    - also add in 2D transformation matrices on the quads, whichever way that will work
- make safe and easy-to-use abstractions for myself with for example the BufferBundle and texture loading code
- make an outward-facing API for not only loading images but also selecting them, the current
  index based system sucks and is unsafe as hell

## Surface API
- make a bunch of working signatures that can later be filled in
